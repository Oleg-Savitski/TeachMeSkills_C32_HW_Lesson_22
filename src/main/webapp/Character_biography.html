<h2>Napoleon I Bonaparte</h2>

<h1>Napoleon I Bonaparte (August 15, 1769 â€” May 5, 1821) was the Emperor of France in 1804-1815,
    a great commander and statesman who laid the foundations of the modern French state.
    Napoleon Bonaparte was born in Ajaccio, Corsica.
    In the period 1805-1807, the emperor won a number of victories over Austrian, Prussian and Russian troops in Europe.
    In the spring of 1814, the Allied armies entered Paris, and Napoleon was forced to abdicate and go into exile on the island of Elba.
    After an in-depth study of the French language at the College of Autun, in 1779 Napoleon was admitted to the Brienne Military School.
    In 1784, he transferred to the Paris Military School, where classes were more serious and where he studied mathematics deeply, dreaming of serving in the artillery.
    After graduating from the Paris Military School in 1785, he served for several years in provincial garrisons, persistently engaged in self-education.
    The turbulent events of the Great French Revolution also affected Napoleon's homeland, from where his family was forced to move to France in 1793.</h1>
